<h1>Quick-Sort</h1>

<strong>Description </strong>This is the second half of Lab04 and is worth 50 points. In this lab assignment (Lab04-2), your job is to implement the randomized version of Quick-sort. That is, you must choose a random pivot from the elements in <em>A</em>[<em>pâ€¦r</em>] when partitioning the subarray. For more details, see page 179 of the textbook. The following webpage describes a simple way to obtain a random integer: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/

<strong>Input structure </strong>The input starts with an integer number which indicates the number of elements (integers) to be sorted, <em>n</em>. Then, the elements follow, one per line.

<strong>Output structure </strong>Output the elements in non-decreasing order. Each element must be followed by ;.

<strong>Examples of input and output:</strong>

<em>Input</em>

6

5

3

2

6

4

<em>Output</em>

1;2;3;4;5;6;

Note that the output is only one line and has no white characters.
